To run this project, 
Use FloydHub for the Jupyter Notebook presented in the folder. This can be used to run the code with the help of GPU provided by FloydHub. 

The native python files are the same code as the Jupyter Notebook attached but will require nVidia CUDA installation on the host machine with a minimum of 8GB GPU.

The dataset can be found at the following locations:
